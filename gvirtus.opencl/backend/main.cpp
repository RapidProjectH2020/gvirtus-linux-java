/**
 * @mainpage gVirtuS - A GPGPU transparent virtualization component
 *
 * @section Introduction
 * gVirtuS tries to fill the gap between in-house hosted computing clusters,
 * equipped with GPGPUs devices, and pay-for-use high performance virtual
 * clusters deployed  via public or private computing clouds. gVirtuS allows an
 * instanced virtual machine to access GPGPUs in a transparent way, with an
 * overhead  slightly greater than a real machine/GPGPU setup. gVirtuS is
 * hypervisor independent, and, even though it currently virtualizes nVIDIA CUDA
 * based GPUs, it is not limited to a specific brand technology. The performance
 * of the components of gVirtuS is assessed through a suite of tests in
 * different deployment scenarios, such as providing GPGPU power to cloud
 * computing based HPC clusters and sharing remotely hosted GPGPUs among HPC
 * nodes.
