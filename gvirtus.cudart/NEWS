12/11/2010 - second beta release
From this release (01-beta2) we support cudatoolkit >= 3.1. The legacy 
compatibility for cudatoolkit versions older than 3.1 is not guaranteed.
In this release there are also some minor changes and bugfixes.
The frontend now is named "libcudart.so.3", so it is not needed anymore to 
rename it or to preload it.
The AfUnix communicator now has a new (optional) option, "mode" for
setting the permission on the socket file (0660 for default).

suggestions.
